**Database Source:** [Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)    
**Description:** The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset comprises 400 rows and 13 columns, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits. It includes details such as gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity level, stress levels, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders. The database has been synthetically generated and is only used for illustrative purposes.    
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, DQL (Data Query Language), Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions.    
**Tools** PgAdmin, Visual Studio Code.    
**Results:** I explored various aspects of the dataset, including demographics, sleep patterns, physical activity levels, and health metrics, such as stress levels. By utilizing window functions, I gained valuable insights into individual and group-level trends, enabling us to identify top performers, distribution patterns, and key characteristics among individuals and different occupations.
